## Project
This is a two-quarters-long capstone project at UC Santa Barbara. We team up with Workday to create a unified student finance system to keep track of all student's spendings and earnings, integrated with Workday Student and NFC on Android.

## Problem 
A significant portion of becoming an adult in modern America is learning financial responsibility. One of the hurdles that young adults face while focusing on school is taking control and managing their money. It becomes difficult to live within your means when your school expenses are abstracted away online. The ideal solution would provide useful statistics to students based on their spending habits, show exactly where their money is going while being able to deposit and withdraw money instantly from virtually any source.

## Solution 
Our System provides a unified, easy to use platform for all student finances. To accomplish this, we draw financial information from Workday Cloud Platform, on-campus purchases, and online purchases related the university. We then analyze this information, generate informative analytics and display them to the user.

We also want to make payments for on-campus charges as simple as possible. To integrate on-campus purchases into our web app, we provide an Android app which allows a student to make payments at on-campus stores via Near Field Communication or with a QR code. If you are purchasing something like a cup of coffee, the entire interaction should take less than 20 seconds. We aim to do this by creating a simple companion app that uses your phone as the payment system. Any purchase made on campus would be reflected for students to see and reflect upon at a later time.

Our system will make use of artificial intelligence to track student’s financial habits and provide suggestions. These suggestions are intended to help guide the student’s spending so they can budget appropriately and maintain healthy financial habits.
