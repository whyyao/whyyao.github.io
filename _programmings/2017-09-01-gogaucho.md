## Project Overview
A friend and I created an UC Santa Barbara campus mobile application. With more than 10,000 users in total with both Android and iOS platform. It is not an official Application, but with our progression, we partnered with UCSB IT department and utilized UCSB API for  course information, dining hall udpates, etc. 

## Involvement 
I was mainly in responsible of the development of Android Application and product management. On the product management side, we conducted user studies on improving user experiences and interface designs, managed a team of 30 and held weekly project meetings; brainstormed and planned for future updates and new features and promoted the App and make is more accessible for students.

## Features
The feature of the application includes checking dinning common's menu, remaining meal balances, marking and getting reminded of favorite food items, nagivating through campus, checking daily class schedules.
