## Motivation
This project draws inspiration from the Fitness App available on iOS. Following Google's announcement of Health Connect services in 2022, I embarked on a quest to find an application that harnesses this functionality, aggregating fitness data from various apps and presenting it within a centralized tracking system. Disappointed by the absence of a satisfactory option, I resolved to develop my own solution. Hence, the inception of this project.

## Health Connect

## Android 
The application is crafted using **Jetpack Compose**, leveraging the capabilities of **Health Connect**, **Widget with Jetpack Glance**, **Services**, **Navigation component**, **Hilt Dependency Injection** and **Coroutine**.
