Our project is a computer science course assignment that involves creating an Android-based app with instant messaging functionality. To achieve this, we have utilized __Firebase__ as our database. Additionally, we have incorporated the __Google Translate API__ to provide a translation feature that enables users to communicate with individuals who speak different languages. With our app, users can select their preferred language, allowing them to effectively communicate with others regardless of language barriers.
