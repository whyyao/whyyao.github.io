### Motivation 
About 13 million tonnes of food goes to waste in the United Kingdom every year. The existing practices for
consumption and production of food are far from desirable. __The UN Sustainable Development Goal 12__ targets to reduce
food wastage at the retail and consumption stage by 50% through reduce, reuse, recycle strategy. This problem is
multilevel and affected by farming practices, production, procurement, transportation, consumption, and so on. 

Still, people do not have much awareness about the impact of their existing food practices on the environment.
Several reliable estimates suggest that cereals and vegetables contribute to well-over 50% of wasted food in the UK. Our motivation was to reduce food waste by targeting a population that is generally not addressed by most existing food waste applications–__single person households__.

### Design Process
### Background Research

| Previous research mainly focus on family setting instead of individual households.  | Existed apps address the food waste problem partly by expecting users to either reuse or recycle food. | 
| Most proposed solutions intervened in food storage and consumption stages. Lack of them invesgated how to reduce overbuying during shopping. | The feedback about food nearing expiry wasn't sufficient to trigger a response from the user.|

### Usability Tests
To evaluate if our design is accessible and useful in the real world, we conducted a usability test with six participants using our pilot mobile app. We coded the feedback and utilized an affinity map to categorize them. The findings mainly focused on the application functions:  
- Interaction for consuming or sharing food items was unnatural and caused confusion
- Environmental contributions displayed on the achievement page are not relatable to individuals

### Final Design  
#### Recording  
1. __Scan to read__ <br />
Users can scan and record food items while shopping.
2. __Repeated item reminder__ <br />
When a newly scanned food item overlaps with what already exists, the app automatically reminds the users  by a 'repeated' tag and a substitution recommendation.

#### Tracking  
1. __Expiring reminder__ <br />
The application will automatically alert users through system pop-up notifications, the top card on the homepage, and countdown tags of the food items list items.
2. __Expiring item process__ <br />
The application provides three actionable alternatives to users: tagging it for immediate consumption, sharing it with others through the application, or setting another customized reminder. 
3. __Feedback__ <br />
A pop-up will appear and display the total quantity of carbon dioxide saved when the users finish processing.

#### Achievement  
1. __Personal contribution sum-up__
The top sum-up card shows individual cumulative food savings, and the quantity of reduced carbon emission.
2. __Leaderboard__
The leaderboard conveys social presence to motivate users to pay attention to food waste.
3. __Foodible’s contribution__
A sum-up of the expected contributions from all Foodible users is presented at the end of the profile page
