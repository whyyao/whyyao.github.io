### Motivation 
About 13 million tonnes of food goes to waste in the United Kingdom every year. The existing practices for
consumption and production of food are far from desirable. __The UN Sustainable Development Goal 12__ targets to reduce
food wastage at the retail and consumption stage by 50% through reduce, reuse, recycle strategy. This problem is
multilevel and affected by farming practices, production, procurement, transportation, consumption, and so on. 

Still, people do not have much awareness about the impact of their existing food practices on the environment.
Several reliable estimates suggest that cereals and vegetables contribute to well-over 50% of wasted food in the UK. Our motivation was to reduce food waste by targeting a population that is generally not addressed by most existing food waste applicationsâ€“__single person households__.
### Design Process
### Background Research

| Previous research mainly focus on family setting instead of individual households.  | Existed apps address the food waste problem partly by expecting users to either reuse or recycle food. | 
| Most proposed solutions intervened in food storage and consumption stages. Lack of them invesgated how to reduce overbuying during shopping. | The feedback about food nearing expiry wasn't sufficient to trigger a response from the user.|

### Usability Tests
To evaluate if our design is accessible and useful in the real world, we conducted a usability test with six participants using our pilot mobile app. We coded the feedback and utilized an affinity map to categorize them. The findings mainly focused on the application functions:  
- Interaction for consuming or sharing food items was unnatural and caused confusion
- Environmental contributions displayed on the achievement page are not relatable to individuals
