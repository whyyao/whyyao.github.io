### Motivation
Recent research indicates that as of June 2021, 1.5% of the UK population has been afflicted with long-term COVID-19 infection, resulting in a range of symptoms that continue to impact their daily lives. Among these symptoms, **sleep disorders** feature prominently, with at least 40% of long-term COVID patients exhibiting moderate to severe sleep disturbances, and significantly higher rates of insomnia compared to those who have not contracted COVID-19. 

Sleep problems not only result in fatigue and poor concentration but are also strongly associated with mental health issues such as depression, stress, and anxiety. Such outcomes highlight a need to target sleep problems. The primary design aim thereby was to **facilitate relaxation and expedite sleep onset**, meeting the needs of users who seek to enhance their sleep quality and return to pre-COVID states of functioning.
