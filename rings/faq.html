<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3> Is your fitness data not accurate? </h3>
<p> Rings doesn't directly track your fitness activities but serves as a hub to display your fitness data across different apps. If you're not currently using any apps to track your fitness activities, we recommend trying Fitbit or Google Fit. Don't forget to sync data with Health Connect in their app settings respectively so that Rings can access them. </p>
